										 <!-- <p>This paper examines the trading behavior of members of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). First, we calculate the financial market returns of FOMC members relative to the overall market
												and examine if there is any evidence of abnormal returns. Second, we test whether FOMC members exhibit evidence of market timing around monetary policy announcements. We do not find any evidence that FOMC officials select securities
												that earn abnormal returns. However, our results regarding market timing are mixed. Though we do not find any evidence of security selection or portfolio rebalancing with respect to monetary policy decisions, we do find that stock sales
												by FOMC officials are typically succeeded by negative returns in the overall stock market.</p> -->

								<p>We quantify fiscal inflation through the lens of incomplete information between funded and unfunded fiscal shocks. Information friction naturally breaks the Ricardian equivalence for deficits to be inflationary.
									We identify the unfunded shock through a pair of interconnected short-term inflation and debt targets that vary over time. Qualitatively, incomplete information alters the effects of both monetary and fiscal
									shocks on inflation. Quantitatively, in response to an unfunded shock, the inflation responses are approximately 40%-60% lower compared to the case of full information. Both fiscal stimulus and supply shocks
									contribute significantly to COVID inflation.

										This paper examines partisanship in public perceptions of the Federal Reserve. In all years from 2001 through 2023, trust in the Federal Reserve was highest for respondents of the same party as the President.
											The partisan effects were larger than other demographic differences in trust, but do not explain the large partisan gap in inflation expectations in those years. We conducted a new survey-based information experiment before and after
											the Presidential inauguration in 2025, and found a changed pattern: Republicans continued to have lower trust in the Fed than did Democrats, even after a Republican President was elected and took office. Yet, Republicans had much
											lower inflation expectations than Democrats. Responses to open-ended survey questions point to tariffs and President Trump himself as most salient to consumers when considering how inflation will evolve.</p>

									<p>Members of a monetary union have limited control over monetary policy. This can elevate the role of fiscal policy as the primary macroeconomic tool against country-specific shocks. This paper argues
										that there is an additional channel of transmission of fiscal policy in countries within a union via consumer sentiments. Using data for the European Economic and Monetary union, I provide evidence that the sentiments
										channel for fiscal policy is strongly present in some European countries but the effect is heterogeneous across countries. The strong response of sentiments to fiscal news makes fiscal consolidation more costly in
										relatively high debt euro area countries.

										<!-- </a> (with <a href="https://www.codyacouture.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="sizesmall">Cody Couture</span>) </a></h4> -->
												 <p>We match country-level climatic data with over ten thousand private sector forecasts for advanced and developing economies over three decades. Forecasters issue less accurate inflation predictions following periods of anomalous
													 temperature, with stronger effects in countries with warmer climates and that are classified as emerging market economies. Forecasters perform relatively better in countries where the monetary framework is geared directly to meeting
													 a target for inflation, suggesting that the private sector is better able to anticipate the central bank's response to shocks under that regime. Scope exists to mitigate costly forecast errors through systematic accounting for the
													 effects of climatic factors on inflation, and central bank communication that guides private expectations.

															Floods, Droughts, and Inflation Expectations</a>
															(with <a href="https://vinoddharmarajan.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="sizesmall">Vinod Dharmarajan</span>) </a></h4>
															<p>This paper examines whether precipitation related natural disasters like floods and droughts affect inflation expectations of consumers. We exploit variation in the frequency of floods and droughts related
																disasters across Indian states to understand whether climatic shocks can explain variations in expectation formation process of households. Using data from Reserve Bank of India's inflation expectations survey, we find that,
																on average, an additional flood event in past three months within a state raises households' short term (three month ahead) inflation expectations by 6.7%. An additional drought event raises the short term inflation expectations
																by 5.2%. Floods and droughts also affect the second moment by raising dispersion of expectations, especially for the one-year ahead inflation. Our findings highlight the increasing risk of unanchored inflation expectations, which
																can impede the effectiveness of monetary policy, in a world with increasing climatic events.
