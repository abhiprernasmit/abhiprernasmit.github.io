									Fiscal Policy and Sentiments in a Monetary Union</a></h4></summary>
									<br>
									<p><p16>Abstract:</p16> Members of a monetary union have limited control over monetary policy. This can elevate the role of fiscal policy as the primary macroeconomic tool against country-specific shocks. In this paper,
										I argue that fiscal policy is highly effective at stimulating output in countries via its impact on consumer sentiments. Using data for the European Economic and Monetary union, I provide evidence that the sentiments channel
										for fiscal policy is strongly present in peripheral European countries but absent in core countries. The impact of fiscal policy on consumer sentiments also make fiscal consolidation more costly in terms of output in peripheral
										countries. I validate my empirical findings using a New Keynesian model of currency union where agents form expectations based on non-fundamental factors (animal spirits) correlated with fiscal policy. I show the existence of a
										stronger response of output to fiscal policy through the latter's impact on consumer sentiments.</p>

										<h4> Stock Returns of Federal Reserve Officials.</a> (<a href="https://www.codyacouture.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="sizesmall">with Cody Couture</span>) </a></h4>
												 <p><p16>Abstract:</p16> This paper examines the trading behavior of members of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). First, we calculate the financial market returns of FOMC members relative to the overall market
													  and examine if there is any evidence of abnormal returns. Second, we test whether FOMC members exhibit evidence of market timing around monetary policy announcements. We do not find any evidence that FOMC officials select securities
														that earn abnormal returns. However, our results regarding market timing are mixed. Though we do not find any evidence of security selection or portfolio rebalancing with respect to monetary policy decisions, we do find that stock sales
														by FOMC officials are typically succeeded by negative returns in the overall stock market.</p>

											<h4> Unconventional Monetary Policy and Consumption. </h4>
										<!-- </a><br> -->
												<p><p16>Abstract:</p16> This paper provides empirical evidence on the role played by home mortgages in transmission of unconventional monetary policy.
													Using household level panel data on consumption, I show that the ability of households to refinance their mortgages and extract
													home equity, determines the efficacy of monetary policy in stimulating consumption. Homeowners who refinance their loan in
													response to an expansionary monetary policy shock consume more than other households. This heterogeneity is conditioned by
													local home prices. I find that mortgage owners who refinance their loan in states with higher house prices have higher
													consumption growth following an expansionary shock.</p>

													<h4> Do Forecasters Check the Weather? Climatic Extremes and Inflation Forecast Errors.
															<span class="sizesmall">(with Gunes Kamber and Roland Meeks)</span> </h4>
															<!-- <br>
															<p><p16>Abstract:</p16> Central banks around the world depend on availability of reliable inflation forecasts to fulfil their core policy mandate of price stabilization.
																Climate change have raised concerns about higher macroeconomic volatility and the availability of accurate macroeconomic forecasts. In this paper we ask how the occurrence of
																temperature anomalies affect inflation forecast errors in a sample covering the last three decades. We find that forecasters make larger inflation forecast errors both on average
																in countries experiencing larger temperature anomalies, and also following an observed temperature anomaly. Forecast errors for EMDEs are particularly sensitive to temperature anomalies,
																with the largest impact occurring in the wake of a hot summer. Forecast disagreement, however, is almost unaffected by weather anomalies, suggesting private sector forecasters may not be
																attentive to them. Our results indicate the need to incorporate climate related indicators in forecasting frameworks, as recently done by many central banks.
