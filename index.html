								<h2> Welcome </h2>
								<br>
								<p18>I am a PhD candidate in economics at the University of California, Irvine. My research interests are in Macroeconomic Policy, Monetary Economics, Behavioral Macroeconomics, Climate change and Macroeconomy. My current work focuses on how
									economic sentiments interact with fiscal policy in a currency union.

							<h8> Fiscal Policy and Sentiments in a Monetary Union. </h8> [Manuscript coming soon]<br>
							<p16> A non-technical summary of the paper is available at: <i> <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/careers/phdinterns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</a></i></p16><br><br>
									<p16>Abstract:</p16> <p17> Members of a monetary union have limited control over monetary policy. This can elevate the role of fiscal policy as the primary macroeconomic tool against country-specific shocks. In this paper
										I argue that fiscal policy is highly effective at stimulating output in countries via its impact on consumer expectations. Using data for the European Economic and Monetary union, I provide evidence that the sentiments
										channel for fiscal policy is strongly present in peripheral European countries but absent in core countries. The impact of fiscal policy on consumer sentiments also make fiscal consolidation more costly in peripheral countries.
										I show that stronger response to fiscal policy by its impact of consumer sentiments can be replicated in a simple model of currency union where agents form expectations based on non-fundamental factors (animal spirits)
										correlated with fiscal policy.

							<h8> Stock Returns of Federal Reserve Officials. <p16><a href="https://www.codyacouture.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(with Cody Couture)</a></p16> </h8><br>
									<p16>Abstract:</p16> <p17>This paper examines the trading behavior of members of the Federal Reserveâ€™s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). We calculate the
									financial market returns of FOMC members relative to the overall market and examine if there is any evidence of
									abnormal returns. We also test whether FOMC members exhibit evidence of market
									timing around FOMC meeting dates. In both cases, we find no evidence of abnormal returns.</p17>

							<h8> Unconventional Monetary Policy and Consumption. </h8><br>
									<p16>Abstract:</p16> <p17> This paper provides empirical evidence on the role played by home mortgages in transmission of unconventional monetary policy.
										Using household level panel data on consumption, I show that the ability of households to refinance their mortgages and extract
										home equity, determines the efficacy of monetary policy in stimulating consumption. Homeowners who refinance their loan in
										response to an expansionary monetary policy shock consume more than other households. This heterogeneity is conditioned by
										local home prices. I find that mortgage owners who refinance their loan in states with higher house prices have higher
										consumption growth following an expansionary shock.</p17>
